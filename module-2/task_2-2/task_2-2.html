      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				const is for values you arent gonna change. Let is for when you're going to reassign the value.
			</p>
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				Its a grouping operator that can be used to change the default order og operations. example: 3 * (2 + 3)
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				We use the .toFixed() method.
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				Normally, you'd use == or === but its better to use the Epsilon Method where you set a tolerance level
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				Comparison operators like ===, ==, and > will return a Boolean value, which is either true or false.
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				It chooses a random value, like a dice. Can be used for choosing random numbers or items fom an array.
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				How to find whats left over after something has been devided.
